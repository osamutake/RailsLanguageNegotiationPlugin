    Adjust priority of template file without language specification
    
    When template files 'some.html.en' and 'some.html' exist,
    request for 'some.ja' should be processed with 'some.html'
    instead of 'some.html.en'.
    
    See
    http://github.com/osamutake/RailsLanguageNegotiationPlugin/issues#issue/1
    
    Other improvements:
    
     - removed not being used
         ActionController::AbstractRequest::language
    
     - calls for
         ActionController::AbstractRequest.accepts_languages.first
       were replaced by those for
         ActionController::AbstractRequest.language_priority.first
    
     - optimized template_handler_extension extraction from template_path
       in ActionView::Base::_pick_template
    
     - removed not being used
         ActionController::Caching::Actions::ActionCachePath::language
